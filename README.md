Use Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) to train an end-to-end self driving system in a [simulator](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim).

- drive.py: script for applying model in self-driving.
`python drive.py model.h5`
- model.py: code for training the model. Data needs to be collected in the simulator for starting the training.
